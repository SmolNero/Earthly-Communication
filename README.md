# Earthly Communication

_An emotional operating system in C++._

This project is the experimental software companion to the ongoing essay series [**Earthly Communications**](https://smolnero.com), which explores recursion, memory, and emotional systems through the lens of language, architecture, and code.

Each file in this repository represents a phase of inner processing—compiled not for deployment, but for reflection. You won’t find feature sets or roadmaps here in the traditional sense. Instead, you’ll find emotional logic implemented in C++. Fragments of attention. Memory rituals. Slow computation of the self.

### Current Phase: `Retained Heap`
We begin where most systems stall: in what lingers.  
Objects that resist collection. Emotions that overstayed.  
This directory holds the first pass at building from what remains.
