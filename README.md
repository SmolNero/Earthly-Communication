This project is the experimental software companion to the ongoing essay series [**Earthly Communications**](https://smolnero.com), which explores recursion, memory, and emotional systems through the lens of language, architecture, and code.

Each file in this repository represents a phase of inner processing—compiled not for deployment, but for reflection. You won’t find feature sets or roadmaps here in the traditional sense. Instead, you’ll find emotional logic implemented in C++. Fragments of attention. Memory rituals. Slow computation of the self.

## What is Earthly Communication?
Personal reflection, emotional regulation, and mental decluttering.
An emotional operating system — part self-awareness tool, part journaling space, part logic-based meditation.

It lets users visualize, track, and prune their emotional memory in a way that mirrors how computers process and manage data.

## Who is this for?
Writers, philosophers, and artists who crave a structured space for emotional logic

Technologists looking for meaning in their abstractions

People recovering from burnout, over-identification, or social noise

Anyone who feels too online and wants to reflect offline — with intention

## Why now?
We’re overwhelmed with fast data and shallow feedback loops.
Earthly Communication slows things down.
It’s a system for those who want to debug their emotional stack — not escape it.


### Notes
- Essays are published separately at [smolnero.com](https://smolnero.com).
- This codebase is not a product. It’s a companion.
- Feel free to fork, adapt, or just read through the files like you would a book.
